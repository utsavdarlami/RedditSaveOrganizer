* Reddit Save Management

Trying to create web-app to organize the saved reddit post. 

** Current Feature:
- Search through your saved post

** Plans
- Display based on category 
- Drag and drop UI to change the post category and reflect on database

** Usage
*** Configuring Praw (Reddit python interface) 

/Praw is a library that interfaces with the Reddit API for you. It limits how many requests you can make, and makes it easy to extract the json responses./

/You need to do a bit of setup first though in order for the bot to be able to post to Reddit./

/Go to: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps And select Create App/

/Give it a name. You have to choose a redirect uri (for some stupid reason, stupid because I'm building a bot, not a webapp, but whatever). I chose http://127.0.0.1/

/You /will now get a client_id (red box below) and secret (blue box below). Note it down, but keep it secret.//

/Now, you need to update your praw ini file to remember these settings. Otherwise, you’ll have to put them in your script and thats dangerous (as others might see them)./

/This page describes how to change praw.ini files: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/v4.0.0/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html/

[[./app/praw_guide.jpg]]

**** Example ~praw.ini~ file (inside /app)

#+begin_src  
[mysavebot]
client_id: <client_id> 
client_secret: <clien_secret> 
password: <password> 
username: <username> 
#+end_src

*** How to run
- Your system must have *docker* and *docker-compose* installed
- Clone this repo
- Configure the praw.ini file and place it inside */app* directory 
- cd in the directory with ~docker-compose.yml~
